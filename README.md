# Web-Programming

I made a website during the time I was studying about web developing.

I host my website on my own server. It's running with Linux (Ubuntu dsitribution), core Dual 2, 4Gb ( An old computer which I've gotten from my school since they don't need it anymore). It work pretty well. I even up load my Recurrent Neural Network there. However, I took it down for a while since I need to modify some files in the server.

I keep all the source codes here in case one day I need it to revise what I've learnt.
